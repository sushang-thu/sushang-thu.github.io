I will initially focus on three projects in my research lab.

1) Exploration of transcription factors that determine the cellular dormancy fate of disseminated prostate cancer cells. 

2) Development of a novel loci-specific proteomic approach to reveal new transcription regulators of key driver genes in prostate cancer. 

3) Development of peptide PROTAC degraders against undruggable target proteins in prostate cancer.
