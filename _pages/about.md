<p>Hi, great to meet you here!</p>
<p>My name is Shang Su, currently a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Xiaohong Liâ€™s lab in Van Andel Institute (Grand Rapids, Michigan, US). This website is designed to post my tech blogs in learning bioinformatics and some research notes.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to visit my personal blog in <a href="https://jixingsu.github.io/">Chinese</a> , where I post my daily experiences and thoughts.</p>
<p>I am still learning how to establish website. So if you see some weird things, just forget it!</p>

# About Me

Wait! I am still thinking of how to wrap up an eye-catching introduction. LOL!



# Recent News

* Shang just learned several analysis pipelines in species-specific analysis of xenograft/coculture RNA-Seq samples.
* Two manuscripted submitted in April 2020. Finger crossed!
