# About Me

I got both my PhD and BS degrees from School of Life Sciences in Tsinghua University, China. After a short dip into industrial job, I realized I am more enthusiastic in basic scientific research. So I came to US and joined <a href="https://xiaohonglilab.com/">Dr. Xiaohong Li's group</a> as a post-doc. I received a DoD EHDA grant in 2022 and was promoted to Research Assistant Professor in July 2023.
I am currently performing projects on developing new approaches to understand drivers in prostate cancer bone metastases, with emphasis on targeted protein degradation approaches.

In my previous experiences, I worked on cell cycle and Wnt signaling, also on PROTAC-induced CDK6 degradation.
