<p>Hi, great to meet you here!</p>
<p>My name is Shang Su, currently a Research Assistant Professor in <a href="https://xiaohonglilab.com/">Dr. Xiaohong Liâ€™s lab</a> at the University of Toledo (UT). I will start <a href="https://sushang.me/sushanglab.github.io">my own research group</a> as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in the Department of Comparative Biomedical Sciences at Louisiana State University (LSU) in August 2024. A new chapter in my life! </p>

<p>This website is designed to post my tech blogs in learning bioinformatics and some research notes.</p>
<!--<p>You are also welcome to visit my personal blog in <a href="https://sushang.life/">Chinese</a> , where I periodically post my daily experiences and thoughts.</p>-->
<p>Please feel free to reach out to me via email: shang.su # at # utoledo.edu</p>

# About Me

I got both my PhD and BS degrees from School of Life Sciences in Tsinghua University, China. After a short dip into industrial job, I realized I am more enthusiastic in basic scientific research. So I came to US and joined <a href="https://xiaohonglilab.com/">Dr. Xiaohong Li's group</a> as a post-doc. I received a DoD EHDA grant in 2022 and was promoted to Research Assistant Professor in July 2023. I will serve as an Assistant Professor in LSU starting from August, 2024. Currently, I am the PI of two DOD EHDA grants and the Co-I for another DOD EHDA grant (PI: Dr. Xiaohong Li, my postdoc mentor).
I am interested in developing new approaches to understand drivers in prostate cancer bone metastases, with emphasis on targeted protein degradation approaches.

In my previous experiences, I worked on cell cycle and Wnt signaling, also on PROTAC-induced CDK6 degradation.
