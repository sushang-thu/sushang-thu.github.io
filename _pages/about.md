<p>Hi, great to meet you here!</p>
<p>My name is Shang Su, currently a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Xiaohong Liâ€™s lab. We moved from Van Andel Institute (Grand Rapids, Michigan, US) to the University of Toledo Medical Center (Toledo, Ohio, US) in July, 2020. This website is designed to post my tech blogs in learning bioinformatics and some research notes.</p>
<p>You are also welcome to visit my personal blog in <a href="https://sushang.life/">Chinese</a> , where I post my daily experiences and thoughts.</p>
<p>I am still learning how to establish website. So if you see some weird things, feel free to email me or just forget it lol!</p>

# About Me

I got both my PhD and BS degrees from School of Life Sciences in Tsinghua University, China. After a short dip into industrial job, I realized I am more enthusiastic in basic scientific research. So I came to US and joined Dr. Xiaohong Li's group as a post-doc.
I am currently running a project in prostate cancer bone metastasis and a project in mitochondrial functions.

In my previous experiences, I worked on cell cycle and Wnt signaling, also on PROTAC-induced CDK6 degradation.
