Welcome to Shang Su’s personal website!
Hi, great to meet you here. My name is Shang Su, currently a post-doctoral fellow in Dr. Xiaohong Li’s lab in Van Andel Institute (Grand Rapids, Michigan, US). This website is designed to post my tech blogs in learning bioinformatics and some research notes. You are also welcome to visit my personal blog in Chinese (https://jixingsu.github.io/), where I post my daily experiences and thoughts.
I am still learning how to establish website. So if you see some weird things, just forget it!

# About Me

Wait! I am still thinking of how to wrap up an eye-catching introduction. LOL!



# Recent News

* Shang just learned several analysis pipelines in species-specific analysis of xenograft/coculture RNA-Seq samples.
* Two manuscripted submitted in April 2020. Finger crossed!
