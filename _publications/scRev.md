## Abstract
Metastasis is the cause of most cancer deaths and continues to be the biggest challenge in clinical practice and laboratory investigation. The challenge is largely due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of primary and metastatic tumor populations and the complex interactions among cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment. Therefore, it is important to determine the genotype and phenotype of individual cells so that the metastasis-driving events can be precisely identified, understood, and targeted in future therapies. Single-cell sequencing techniques have allowed the direct comparison of the genomic and transcriptomic changes among different stages of metastatic samples. Single-cell imaging approaches have enabled the live visualization of the heterogeneous behaviors of malignant and non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment. By applying these technologies, we are achieving a spatiotemporal precision understanding of cancer metastases and clinical therapeutic translations.
